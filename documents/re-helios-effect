Major, I’ve attached a paper from some of the pencil necks at MIT you might want
to see. I won’t pretend to understand much of the math, but I do know a golden
goose when I see one: supposedly these kids were able to record the movement of
[Sandinista] guerillas just by staring at the sun. I’m sure there’s some
limitations here, but whatever they’ve got, we need.

Seems nobody’s paid much attention to these kids yet, so I suggest we
immediately contact our folks at the Institute and have them pull the paper.
Reach out to the kids and find a way to sell them on SLS-1. Focus on the scenic
mountaintops and less on the frozen tundra.
