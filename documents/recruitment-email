A Unique Employment Opportunity
1983-5-23

Dear Miss Anya Shahin,

We were very impressed with your work at MIT, and would like to extend a unique
job offer. We are in the process of building the world's most advanced [solar
telescope, capable of reading minute variations in the surface plasma], which
we're calling the Solar Listening Station, or SLS-1.

Please let us know what you think. The station should be operational by early
next year.

Regards,
Maj. Calvin Grubbs,
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
