The Helios Effect and its Applications

Authors: Anya Shahin, [Randall Eli]

Abstract: We observe a novel phenomenon, which we’ve dubbed The Helios Effect,
in the sun’s electromagnetic radiation caused by the movement of solar plasma.
We demonstrate how, with proper demodulation and sufficiently sensitive
observational equipment, the Helios Effect allows an Earth-bound observer to
make inferences about a vast array of phenomena within the solar system,
including events happening on the Earth itself. We formulate a theoretical
framework for how the Helios Effect is created, as well as some surprising and
troubling conclusions regarding its applications in [surveillance], [espionage],
and even [interpersonal privacy].
